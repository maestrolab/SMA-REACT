# SMA REACT
SMA-REACT is an open-source, (hopefully) easy-to-use
tool for processing shape memory alloy experimental data and calibrating a constitutive model for use in other analyses(e.g., Abaqus).
Data processing and model calibration are presented in the form of a python GUI, allowing those unfamiliar with the intricate details of SMA constitutive modeling to easily calibrate appropriate models without writing their own custom subroutines. 
SMA-REACT is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License, which [``allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of warranty are maintained.''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)

## Downloads

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/maestrolab/SMA_REACT/releases) page and download the SMA_REACT executable for your operating system. Click **Assets** to expand the list of downloadable files. You can also download the 'input.zip' file which contains sample input files for the SMA_REACT software.

2. If you prefer to install the software from source, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies manually. We recommend doing this in a **virtual environment** to avoid package conflicts.
	
	2a. **Clone the repository**:
	
	    ```bash
	    git clone https://github.com/maestrolab/SMA_REACT.git
	    cd SMA_REACT
	    ```
	
	2b. **(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment**:
	
	    - **On macOS/Linux**:
	
	        ```bash
	        python3 -m venv venv
	        source venv/bin/activate
	        ```
	
	    - **On Windows**:
	
	        ```cmd
	        python -m venv venv
	        venv\Scripts\activate
	        ```
	
	2c. **Install the package and its dependencies** (from the directory containing the `pyproject.toml` file):
	
	    ```bash
	    pip install .
	    ```
	
	This will install all required packages with the correct versions as defined in the project.

3. If you prefer not to use `pip install .`, you can manually install the required packages individually (ensure you get the correct package versions).

## Documentation
