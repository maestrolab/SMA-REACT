Their formulation and underlying principles are presented and discussed. These identification techniques are then applied to full-field experimental data obtained on four different experiments, namely (i) a tensile test, (ii) the Brazilian test, (iii) a shear-flexural test, and (iv) a biaxial test. Test (iv) features a non-uniform damage field, and hence non-uniform equivalent elastic properties, while tests (i), (ii) and (iii) deal with the identification of uniform anisotropic elastic properties. Tests (ii), (iii) and (iv) involve non-uniform strain fields in the region of interest.},

These algorithms enable both the yield criterion and the work hardening parameters to be identified. A hybrid algorithm is also used, which is a combination of the former two, in such a way that the result of the genetic algorithm is considered as the initial values for the gradient-based algorithm. The objective of this approach is to improve the performance of the gradient-based algorithm, which is strongly dependent on the initial set of results. The constitutive model used to compare the three different optimization schemes uses the Barlat’91 yield criterion, an isotropic Voce type law and a kinematic Lemaitre and Chaboche law, which is suitable for the case of aluminium alloys. In order to analyse the effectiveness of this optimization procedure, numerical and experimental results for an EN AW-5754 aluminium alloy are compared.},

Field comparisons are performed at several time steps until fracture occurs and a Levenberg–Marquardt method is used to solve the optimization problem. Six parameters of an anisotropic elastic–plastic constitutive model are identified and validated through the simulation of a deep-drawing forming operation.

	abstract = {Purpose - Parameter identification is a technique which aims at determining material or other process parameters based on a combination of experimental and numerical techniques. In recent years, heuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), have been proposed as possible alternatives to classical identification procedures. The present work shows that particle swarm optimization (PSO), as an example of such methods, is also appropriate to identification of inelastic parameters. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - PSO is a class of swarm intelligence algorithms which attempts to reproduce the social behaviour of a generic population. In parameter identification, each individual particle is associated to hyper-coordinates in the search space, corresponding to a set of material parameters, upon which velocity operators with random components are applied, leading the particles to cluster together at convergence. Findings - PSO has proved to be a viable alternative to identification of inelastic parameters owing to its robustness (achieving the global minimum with high tolerance for variations of the population size and control parameters), and, contrasting to GAs, higher convergence rate and small number of control variables. Originality/value - PSO has been mostly applied to electrical and industrial engineering. This paper extends the field of application of the method to identification of inelastic material parameters.},

A material specification centers on mill product wrought NiTi or NiTi + X + X′ based alloys, where X and X′ can be any alloying element addition to the base NiTi. This standard is aimed toward specifying the chemical, mechanical, thermal, and metallurgical requirements of NiTi-based alloys. Two newly proposed standard test methods are aimed toward expanding the applicability of the following published SMA actuator standards: E3097—Standard Test Method for Uniaxial Constant Force Thermal Cycling (UCFTC) and E3098—Standard Test Method for Uniaxial Pre-strain and Thermal Free Recovery (UPFR). First, Force-Controlled Repeated Thermal Cycling (FCRTC), addresses repeated thermal cycling under a constant force and associated terminology. FCRTC’s primary objective is to address failure with regard to the SMA material’s ability to perform its function as an actuator for an application’s required lifecycle. Second, Constant Torque Thermal Cycling (CTTC) deals with thermally cycling SMAs under a constant torque for rotary actuator applications. Key features of each proposed standard and progress on their development are outlined, considering novelty and applicability to actuation from raw material to final actuator component in its application.},

	abstract = {Development of melting and processing techniques for NiTiHf high-temperature shape memory alloys at the laboratory scale has resulted in pronounced success and repeatability for actuation purposes. Even the Ni-rich NiTiHf formulations, which are more challenging from a compositional control standpoint since small changes in chemistry can result in large transformation temperature variations, are reproducibly processed at the laboratory scale. Since properties of the slightly Ni-rich NiTiHf alloys have proved promising, large-scale production of such alloys now requires renewed attention. In this work, several melting techniques were used to process NiTi-20Hf (at.\%), ranging from vacuum induction melting to plasma arc melting, with heats ranging in size from 0.4 to 250 kg with a target composition of Ni50.3Ti29.7Hf20 (at.\%). All cast ingots were subsequently hot extruded into bar. The resulting chemistries, microstructures, and inclusion types and sizes were evaluated as a function of melting technique. Finally, the thermophysical, mechanical and functional properties were measured for a number of material heats that varied in size and primary processing technique. The results indicated that various melting techniques could result in alloys with slightly different end compositions that can affect the mechanical and functional properties. Some of the compositional changes are inherent to the melting process, such as formation of carbides, Ni loss, and other attributes that can be adjusted or minimized by optimizing melting practices. Finally, alloy properties were correlated to the actual compositions of each heat, through corrections based on differential scanning calorimetry measurements, indicating that most scatter in properties can be explained by slight chemistry variations.},

This has posed many difficulties for the research and development of SMMs and has caused the field to move slowly.

SM2ART provides unrestricted access to data from thousands of peer-reviewed articles and published data. These data are organized in a 2D and 3D visualization platform and provides viewers insight into shape memory alloys (SMAs), superelastic alloys, magnetic alloys, shape memory polymers (SMPs), and shape memory ceramics (SMCs).

Binary NiTi, in particular, is known for its remarkable shape memory properties, mechanical strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. These properties can be further enhanced and better controlled through alloying NiTi with ternary, quaternary, and higher-order elements. Recently, researchers at NASA have compiled an extensive database of shape memory properties of materials, including over 8000 multi-component Ni–Ti alloys containing 37 different alloying elements. Using the Ni–Ti dataset, we train machine learning models to explore shape memory behavior of Ni–Ti alloys over a large compositional and processing space. The models predict transformation temperatures, hysteresis, and transformation strain, with low mean absolute errors of 14.8 °C, 7.2 °C, and 0.36\%, respectively. We use these models to map trends and learn relationships between shape memory behavior and different parameters in the input design space. They can be used to make predictions for any multi-component alloy, without need for additional training. The combination of an extensive experimental dataset and accurate learning models, together, make our approach highly suitable for the discovery and design of new alloys with targeted properties.},

	abstract = {Efforts to create efficient and lighter aeronautical structures are defining morphing systems especially those associated with smart materials. In this regard, three simple mechanisms using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are investigated to generate torque that could be used for flap actuation. The devices consist of an SMA wire biased by a linear spring in the following configurations: concurrent, collinear, and in parallel attached to a pulley. The design of such mechanisms are modeled, optimized, and experimentally verified. The model for the flap consists of two rigid bodies, one fixed and the other rotating, with a single actuator connected to each body. Aerodynamic loading and heat transfer analysis are also considered. The model utilizes the thermomechanical properties for an SMA wire experimentally characterized via improved inverse problem techniques. A multiobjective genetic optimization is implemented to find designs for the three configurations that minimize power consumption and maximize flap deflection magnitude. Overall, as design complexity (i.e., number of degrees of freedom) increases, the power to achieve a certain flap deflection decreases. The maximum deflection for all three mechanisms is sufficient for typical aircraft operations. Finally, numerical results were verified via an experimental apparatus, where similar performance to the model was achieved.},

	abstract = {One of the obstacles to the deployment of shape memory alloys (SMAs) in solid-state actuation is the low efficiency and functional instability due to the transformation thermal hysteresis and large temperature ranges during martensitic phase transformation. Numerous studies have been conducted in an effort to minimize the thermal hysteresis and transformation temperature range of SMAs through ternary and quaternary alloying of known binary alloy systems, such as NiTi, and considerable success has been achieved. However, and crucially, the alloys discovered so far have failed to maintain a narrow hysteresis under applied stress. In the present study, an AI-enabled materials discovery framework was successfully used to identify both SMA chemistries and the associated thermo-mechanical processing steps that result in narrow transformation hysteresis and transformation range under an applied stress. The major elements of the proposed workflow are described in detail and its materials-agnostic character makes it widely applicable to other alloy discovery challenges. Using this framework, and without relying on subsequent experimental exploratory analysis, an SMA composition, i.e. Ni32Ti47Cu21 (at. \%), was predicted and confirmed to have the narrowest thermal hysteresis and transformation range under stress achieved thus far for a NiTi-based SMA. Furthermore, the alloy was shown to exhibit excellent cyclic stability and actuation strain. The methodology and the dataset introduced here can be extended to design novel SMAs with other target functions.},

One issue impeding their widespread use is the question of actuation fatigue lifetime under high loads. This paper describes how these fatigue challenges can be overcome by partial thermomechanical cycling. By limiting actuation strain to less than the maximum value that is attainable with full transformation, actuation life cycles can be significantly extended. Strain-controlled cycling is achieved by limiting the upper cycle temperature during heating and stopping each cycle short of the austenite finish temperature. Four compositions of NiTiHf were tested to three levels of transformation. Strain-controlled cycling increased the actuation fatigue lifetimes of all compositions. However, specimens resistant to dislocation plasticity attained longer lives during full transformation cycling, but during partial cycling, they failed earlier than samples with higher resistance to plasticity. This highlights the importance of the competition between functional and structural fatigue.},

By utilizing the logarithmic strain and rate, the model is able to account for large strains and rotations that SMA-based components may undertake, but also resolves the stress errors caused by the non-integrable objective rates that are widely used in current commercial finite element software. The model is developed through classical thermodynamic laws combined with the standard Coleman–Noll procedure. The scalar martensitic volume fraction and the second-order transformation strain tensor are chosen as the internal state variables to capture the material response exhibited by polycrystalline SMAs. A detailed implementation procedure of the proposed model is described through a user-defined material subroutine. Numerical experiments considering SMA components including a bar, a beam, a torque tube and a solid flexible structure under stress/thermally-induced phase transformations are investigated via the proposed model, and the results under cyclic loading are compared against the predictions provided by the Abaqus nonlinear solver. The development framework of the proposed model and its implementation procedure can be extended to incorporate other nonlinear phenomena exhibited by SMAs, such as transformation-induced plasticity, viscoplasticity, and damage under large deformation.},

A detailed implementation procedure of the proposed model is presented through a user-defined material subroutine within a finite element framework allowing for solving different Boundary Value Problems (BVPs). Comprehensive instruction on calibrating the model parameters as well as the derivation of continuum tangent stiffness matrix are also provided. In the end, the simulated cyclic pseudoelastic and actuation responses by the presented model for a wide range of SMA material systems under both uniaxial and multiaxial stress states are compared against experimental results to validate the proposed modeling capabilities.},

	abstract = {The one-way and two-way shape memory effects (SMEs) as well as the thermal hysteresis represent fundamental properties when dealing with the design of detachable and thermally-stable connection systems based on shape memory alloys (SMAs). Such properties can be induced and tuned by thermo-mechanical processes that include thermal treatments and severe pre-deformation in martensitic state, causing the onset of plastic strains. In such complex conditions, material modeling is of great importance to support the design. This paper proposes a generalization of the three-dimensional phenomenological constitutive model by Souza et al. (1998), in order to describe the behavior of severely pre-strained NiTi-based SMAs. The proposed model allows to describe pseudoelasticity, one-way and two-way SMEs, as well as additional physical phenomena evidenced experimentally, such as transformation temperatures’ evolution, thermal hysteresis, phase transformations at low stresses, thermal strains, and phase-dependent elastic properties. Several numerical simulations, ranging from uniaxial tests to the finite element analysis of two case-studies, are performed. Model results are in good agreement with the results of a performed experimental campaign and allow to discuss SMA behavior under such complex loading conditions.},
